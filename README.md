# ISACfMgr
ISA Content filter Management
This is a Windows Service Application to download the file "", convert its content to xml, insert/update that content into a MS SQL database, which might be the ISA Server or Forefront TMG database and optionally add those records to the ISA Server configuration or TMG configuration, all the above in a very configurable way.
